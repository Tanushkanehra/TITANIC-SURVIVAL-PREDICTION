# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, passenger class, and fare.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is the classic Titanic dataset and includes columns such as:
- Pclass
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Fare
